## Music as Collective Action

## Beat Terms

* **Beat**: a basic musician unit subdividing time. A regular, recurring pulse or background. The quicker beats succeed each other, the faster **tempo**.
* **Meter**: The effect of grouping accented and unaccented beats into a recurring pattern.
* **Measure**(Bar): A single occurence of this pattern beginning with one **strong** beat.
* **accent** (accented or unaccented): The stressing or emphasis of a beat, by making it louder and causing our sense of meter
* **Metrical** - there is a beat presense; Nonmetrical - no beat

## Meters

* **Duple** meter
  * Two in a measure (bar): ONE (down) two (up) ONE two
  * Four in a measure: ONE (down) two three four (up) ONE
* **Triple** meter
  * Three in a measure: ONE (down) two three (up)
* **Compound** meter
  * Two layers: ONE N/A N/A two N/A N/A / One two three four five six

Meter vs Rhythm: rhythm is the flow of sound; meter is the patterns in the sounds.

**Syncopation**: The displacement of accents in foreground rhythm against background meter
